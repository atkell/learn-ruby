puts "If I run at a pace of 2 miles per hour, how far will I run in 15 minutes? #{2.00 * 15 / 60} miles"

puts "What about if I run at a pace of 4.5 miles per hour? #{4.50 * 15 / 60} miles"

# 1 mile is 5,280 feet.
# 1 mile in 10 minutes (which is 10 / 60 minutes) or 1/6 of an hour
# pace = distance over time
# pace = 1 / (1 / 6) or 1 * 6
puts "What pace is required to run a mile in 10 minutes? #{1.0 * 6} mph"
