# Exercise 12 Study Drill
# Try out the .to_f operation. What does .to_f do?
# To play with .to_f more, make a small script that asks for some money 
# and gives back 10% of it. If I give your script 103.4 (dollars), your 
# script gives me back 10.34 in change.

# Script â€“ Calculate a bad tip! Womp, womp.
